# **T3_To-The-Top**

## Description

This project was conducted from 22.10.13 to 22.11.3 as a computer graphics course in the 2nd semester of the 3rd year of Gachon University.

This project was inspired by **Portal** and **Jump King** and created using an agile approach. 

## Tutorial

It is a game where you step on blocks from the starting point and climb up to arrive at the destination.

You can use the **WASD key** to `move forward, left, back, and right`.

You can `change the viewpoint` by **moving the mouse while pressing the left mouse button**.

You can `throw the ball` by **pressing the left mouse button**.

If the ball hits an object, it will move to that object.
